        <h1>What is 3D Printing?</h1>
        <br>

        <h3>    
            3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid
            objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive
            processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers
            of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced
            cross-section of the object.
            3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing
            out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine. 3D printing enables
            you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing
            methods.

There are many 3D Printing web apps / softwares, like XYZWare, Tinkercad by Autodesk, and many more.</h3>
